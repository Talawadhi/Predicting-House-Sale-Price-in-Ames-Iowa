# Predicting-House-Sale-Price-in-Ames-Iowa
In this project, I'll aim to predict the house sale price in Ames, Iow. The dataset I have was compiled by Dean De Cock, it describes the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. The dataset contains 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous)and can be found .here

I'll analyze the dataset and create a Linear Regression model to see how effectively can we predict the sale price from the house properties.
